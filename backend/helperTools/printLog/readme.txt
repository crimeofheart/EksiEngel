Reading collected logs can be difficult, this small program might help a bit.

I thought customizing admin panel by writing a custom widget for log field in Action object. 
But after a little research, I believe there is no need to put such an effort on this. 

How does it work?
This HTML page powered with JS takes logs in string form. It parses and prints logs to create nice looking table.
