There are major differences between v2.7 and v3.0 in terms of db design. 
The collected data in the form of v2.7 should be transferred into the form of v3.0 somehow. 
My first plan was to running one-off script(s) to convert the data. However, I did nothing so far. 
Outline of this action:
  1. examine the db models of v2.7 and v3.0
  2. decide which data is needed/proper, which data has to be lost during conversion
  3. write the scripts
  4. save the old db into somewhere just in case
  5. delete the old API from Django project (at the moment clients are not using the old API nevertheless)
Current Status: I did nothing so far. 

The backend server has been moved from DigitalOcean to another provider with v3.1
This action did not effect the problem above. All the db and project have been moved into new host.
